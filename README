 * Uberwall udp scanner is a multithreaded udp port scanner. 
 * 
 * This tool was coded on a gentoo box... 
 * If there are some platforms on which it's not working
 * I'm here to try giving support...
 * Actually I'll port the code for BSD in the next few time.
 *
 * Greatz to csk, khorben, sead and friends.
 * A big thanks to csk who forced me to write this and kick my ass
 * to finish it this year :)
